#+TITLE: Haskell Programming Practice

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  -- Haskell is a functional Programming Language
  -- Everything is immutable so once a value is set it is set forever.
  -- Functions can be passed as a parameter to other functions.
  -- Recursion is used often.
  -- Haskell has no for, while, or technically variables, but it does have constants
  -- Haskell is lazy in that it doesn't execute more then is needed and instead just check for errors.

  -- Type ghci to open it up in your terminal
